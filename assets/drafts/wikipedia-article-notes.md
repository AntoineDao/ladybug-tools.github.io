## Notability

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability
* On Wikipedia, notability is a test used by editors to decide whether a given topic warrants its own article.
*  Wikipedia's concept of notability applies this basic standard to avoid indiscriminate inclusion of topics. Article and list topics must be notable, or "worthy of notice". Determining notability does not necessarily depend on things such as fame, importance, or popularityâ€”although those may enhance the acceptability of a subject that meets the guidelines explained below.
