# Wikipedia Guidelines

## Five Pillars

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars

* Wikipedia is an encyclopedia
* Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view
* Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute
* Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility
* Wikipedia has no firm rules

## Rules

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Simplified_ruleset


## Notability

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability
* On Wikipedia, notability is a test used by editors to decide whether a given topic warrants its own article.
*  Wikipedia's concept of notability applies this basic standard to avoid indiscriminate inclusion of topics. Article and list topics must be notable, or "worthy of notice". Determining notability does not necessarily depend on things such as fame, importance, or popularityâ€”although those may enhance the acceptability of a subject that meets the guidelines explained below.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_notability_guidelines
