# http://ladybug-tools.github.io/eval/


_Some ideas - by Theo - put here until they have a proper place to go to_

## Support Page Considerations

### Mission

* Support options are clearly identified
* Developer and user support is clearly identified
* Make it fun and easy for the user community to support the user community
* Capture frequently occuring issues - and make respones easily accessible
* The support effort is part of the effort of spreading the word around the Internet abou Ladybug Tools

## Solutions

#### User issues including installing, implementing, learning etc should go to a [Discourse]( http://www.discourse.org/ ) discussion platform
* Search results appear in Google 

Until a Discourse presence is established, a special GitHub repo for general discussiom and support issues might be useful.

#### User issues including installing, implementing, learning etc should go to Stack Overflow. 
* People who are not Ladybug users may become interested / more cross-marketing possibility
* Support tends to be high quality
* Search results appear in Google 

A Ladybug Tools tag should be established by feeding in some typical questions. Note that Grashopper3D gets co-mingled with other apps named 'grasshopper'. Don't let this happen to Ladybug products. Establish unique tags by usage and then publish appropriate tags for each product. 

#### Bug reports, feature requests and road map issues should go to GitHub Issues
* Things that affect the programmers should go directly to the programmers

Suitable issue tags should be developed for types of issues. Users should be made aware as to which repo to use for different product's issues

#### Reddit

* A subReddit for Ladybug Tols: TBD


#### Twitter hashtag

* Discussions relating to Ladybug Tools on Twitter should incorporate a #ladybug-tool hashtag 

#### Demo Files

I am so used to demos being available online, I am at a loss at the idea of demoing and supporting Ladybug projects. Could I build a Grasshopper/Ladybug emulator that works in the browser?? In 3D of course. ;-)

## Bibliography

A big difference between proprietary and open source is that the latter opens up so many possibilities for peer review and verification.

A good portion of the process depends highly on having free, speedy, easy access to realtime online sources. Old time references without links to out of print books printed on paper are the enemy. 

A proper modern bibliography has links which take you to the appriated page of a book scanned by Google Books ( or whoever ) with am ISBN number that is a link to a number of sources for the original work along with a link to the work as recorded by the Internet Archive in case the previous two methods are disrupted.

_I will try to provide examples of links like these from Wikrpedia in the near future._
