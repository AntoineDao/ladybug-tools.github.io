Bibliography Considerations
===

A big difference between proprietary and open source is that the latter opens up so many possibilities for peer review and verification.

A good portion of the process depends highly on having free, speedy, easy access to real-time online sources. Old time references without links to out of print books printed on paper are the enemy.

A proper modern bibliography has links which take you to the appropriate page of a book scanned by Google Books ( or whoever ) with am ISBN number that is a link to a number of sources for the original work along with a link to the work as recorded by the Internet Archive in case the previous two methods are disrupted.

_I will try to provide examples of links like these from Wikipedia in the near future._
